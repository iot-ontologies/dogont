Today we extended DogOnt to include HeatEnergyCalculator devices. Modeling stems from the analysis of the Kamstrup Multical 602 device, we had to integrate in dog. We also performed some amendment to the hierarchy structure of the ontology to make it more easy to navigate and understand, especially for us humans.

Enjoy this last version of the model, and let us know if you spot any issues or require any integration!
