After over 7 years from its first release, the DogOnt ontology is now available on GitHub, with a completely new documentation web-site. 
We are planning to complete the getting started, cookbok and user guide sections as soon as possible. In the mean while enjoy technology independent modeling supported by DogOnt!

If you wish to contribute, please join the community and start working on the next DogOnt versions!
