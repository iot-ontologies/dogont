<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
DogOnt is a modeling language for IEs (Intelligent Environments), based on Semantic Web technologies. By adopting well known representations such as ontologies and by providing suitable reasoning facilities, DogOnt is able to face interoperation issues allowing to describe:

- where a smart device is located;
- the set of capabilities of a smart device;
- the technology-specific features needed to interface the device;
- the possible configurations that the device can assume;
- how the surrounding environment is composed;
- what kind of architectural elements and furniture are placed inside the home, if the environment considered is a home.

This information can then be leveraged by inference-based intelligent systems to provide advanced functionality required in Intelligent Domotic Environments.  DogOnt is currently adopted as normative data model for the Dog gateway (http://http://dog-gateway.github.io/)</span>
